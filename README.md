InventBar and ParcelBar-1D Barcode Detection: Novel Benchmark Datasets and Comprehensive Comparison of Deep Convolutional Neural Network Approaches

This repository hosts two benchmark datasets — InventBar and ParcelBar — developed as part of the research project: "Developing a prototype system for inventory counting process by integrating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), barcode technology, deep learning, and image processing technology". These datasets are designed to support research in 1D barcode detection and recognition under realistic and challenging conditions.

# Dataset Overview
InventBar: A dataset focused on inventory counting scenarios, containing 527 barcode images with annotations:
  - Images collected using UAVs in indoor inventory environments.
  - Includes various barcode placements (e.g., boxes on shelves, stacked cartons).
  - Diverse angles, lighting conditions, occlusions, and motion blur.

ParcelBar: Tailored to parcel and logistics applications, containing 844 barcode images with annotations:
  - Captured in warehouse and parcel delivery environments.
  - Features dynamic scenes, multiple barcodes per image, and mixed object-background interactions.

Each dataset is annotated with ground-truth barcode bounding boxes and class labels (e.g., barcode type).
